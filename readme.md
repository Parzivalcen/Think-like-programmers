# How to think like a Programmer - Andy Harris Talk

The main thing I'm taking from this is that it does not matter what language you are learning, the syntax is not that important, what we need to learn is to write pseudo *"code"* and algorithms in English or any language that you are comfortable with.

### Problems are always creeping around you
When you encounter a problem (you always will), don't write it in the programing language right away, write it in a sheet of paper first if possible, not in a computer.

The computer is dump and it will not interpret what you want it to do, it will do exactly what you say to it to do. If your algorithm is right you can be sure that your code will work in any language, the syntax can be just googled. Programming its really about teaching things to the *idiot* computer.

Most of the time we don't understand the problem, is not that we don't know what code to write

### Don't code
The first step to writing a program is to write it a sheet of paper or at least in comments of your text editor, DONT WRITE ANY CODE, before you have an algorithm, if the code does not work, tweak your algorithm first not the code, IF possible start fresh with a blank screen. Code explain comments to the computer, they are not for other programmers U.u 

### Input
Never put input at beginning of your code, declare the variable to hold the input, and then ask the user for input. 

### Failure
Most of the times is not a implementation problem, is an algorithm problem. Not understanding a problem, that's a thing that is going to happen every day, we fail all the time.
